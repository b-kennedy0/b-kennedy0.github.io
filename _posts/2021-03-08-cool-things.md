Inspired by Alexandra Lautarescu's [blog post](https://www.alautarescu.com/post/what-i-use-during-my-phd), I needed a place to keep track of all the cool things I find, some of which I actually use. Hopefully some of these you might find useful yourself.

## Computer setup

Apple M1 Macbook Air 2020. The new Apple silicon chip makes this super quick! No problems running multiple programmes and lots of browser tabs. In fact, many apps are getting silicon-specific updates.  

## Analysis

In undergraduate and masters I did analyses through SPSS, but since starting my PhD I have learned to use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)). The resources that I used to get started are:

<https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/index.html>

<https://r4ds.had.co.nz/>

<https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/>

I mostly use [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), which is great for compiling all your code and results into a PDF that you can then share with your collaborators.

<https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/>

I haven't yet gotten to that, but I'm planning to learn to use [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), so I can share my code in an interactive, reproducible way.

For those who are still wary of making the plunge to R, [JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/) and [Jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/) are great alternatives (with user interface similar to SPSS).

I share my code on [Open Science Framework](http://www.osf.io/) or [Github](https://github.com/).

## Figures, illustrations, apps

<http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/>

Sharing snippets of code: <https://carbon.now.sh/>

<https://www.shinyapps.io/>

I do all my figures in [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) (using R). Even if you're not fully converted to R for your analysis, you can still easily use it for your figures. Once you learn how to [load your data into R](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html), there are a lot of resources for easily making plots; here are some great one for [scatterplots](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-scatter-plots-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization), [histograms](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-histogram-plot-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization), [or violin plots.](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-violin-plot-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization) A super fun way to learn how to plot is taking part in [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) and for extra motivation and fun, you can choose to make your plots using colour palettes from [Harry Potter](https://github.com/aljrico/harrypotter) or [Game of Thrones](https://github.com/aljrico/gameofthrones) (or any others you can find - the world is your oyster).

## Writing

I typically write my manuscripts in Word, and email them around to my collaborators, but it's not ideal and very time-consuming (especially when getting feedback on a paper with 5+ coauthors). I tried to use Google Docs, but the conversion from word doc to google doc and back can be a bit iffy and cause you to loose formatting. I'm still looking for the ideal solution (planning to give [Simul](https://www.simuldocs.com/) a try, as it's supposedly good for version control).

Citation manager and keeping up with literature

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)

<https://www.connectedpapers.com/>, produces a visual graph for all papers that are related to one initial paper (i.e. citations etc)

## Communication

[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/) 

[Gathertown](https://gather.town/)

<https://backyard.co/>

<https://email-charter.github.io/>

<https://htmlemail.io/inline/>

<https://jsonlint.com/> - JSON Validator

## Organisation

[Trello](https://trello.com/en) . It's a very visual task-manager where you can have task boards and move your tasks around (from "to do" to "doing" to 'done", sort of like post-it notes). It's great for individual work, but also amazing for collaboration, as you can share your boards with colleagues and assign tasks to each other.

Tracking conferences / publications etc -- Github Pages portfolio.

Google Drive

## Statistics

There are a lot of really cool tiny websites or resources that I've come across, which are helpful for both understanding stats concepts better, or for teaching them.

A really cool website to help you [visualise Cohen's d effect sizes](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend/#:~:text=An%20Interactive%20Visualization&text=The%20Cohen's%20d%20effect%20size,0.8)

[www.guessthecorrelation.com](http://www.guessthecorrelation.com/) An awesome game to help you understand how different correlation coefficients actually look as a scatterplot.

A (you guessed it: really cool) website to help you [visualise the positive predictive value](http://shiny.ieis.tue.nl/PPV/) of the p value

(I will continue this list without repeating how cool these are, but please believe me when I say they're all awesome).

[www.statcheck.io.](http://www.statcheck.io/) A website that can help you detect errors in statistical reporting.

[www.p-curve.com](http://www.p-curve.com/) A visual aid to help you understand the flaws of the p value

The GRIM test - a simple test to detect anomalies in summary statistics in published research (or your own research). You can read about it [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550616673876) and use the tool at <http://nickbrown.fr/GRIM>
