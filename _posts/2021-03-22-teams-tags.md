3. Give your tag a name. This is what you will use to tag in a conversation/announcement. 

4. Add the relevant people to the tag by searching by name or email. When finished click 'Create'.

5. When you are ready to use the tag, simply type the '@' symbol and begin typing the name of your tag, it will come up with a suggestion and you can click that, or press enter.

    When you post your message/annoucnement only those who are part of the tag will recieve the notification.
