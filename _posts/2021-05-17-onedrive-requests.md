<i class="fas fa-exclamation icon-yellow" aria-hidden="true"></i> It seems that this feature needs to be enabled by your Administrator. This will not be available on all OneDrive accounts. See [microsoft support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-file-request-f54aa7f8-2589-4421-b351-d415fc3b83af){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for more info.

# Step 1
Create new folder in OneDrive  
![Folder menu](/assets/img/blog/onedrive-requests/folder.png)

# Step 2
Hover over the folder and click the three dots by the side of the name  
![Request file button](/assets/img/blog/onedrive-requests/newrequest.png)

# Step 3
Give the file request a title and click 'Next'

# Step 4
Copy the link and share with those who need to submit the file. You can Send in an email / Post it in Teams / Create a 'submission link' on Moodle.

# Done!
This is how it looks to the submitter. You will receive an email notification for each new submission - I would recommend setting up an Outlook Rule to automatically move those notifications to a separate folder so as to not fill your inbox!
