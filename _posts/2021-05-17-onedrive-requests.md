# Step 4
Copy the link and share with those who need to submit the file. You can Send in an email / Post it in Teams / Create a 'submission link' on Moodle.

# Done!
This is how it looks to the submitter. You will receive an email notification for each new submission - I would recommend setting up an Outlook Rule to automatically move those notifications to a separate folder so as to not fill your inbox!
