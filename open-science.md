# What is Open Science? 
Open Science represents a new approach to the scientific process based on cooperative work and new ways of diffusing knowledge by using digital technologies and new collaborative tools.  
Open Science is about extending the principles of openness to the whole research cycle (see figure 1), fostering sharing and collaboration as early as possible thus entailing a systemic change to the way science and research is done. - [FOSTER](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/content/what-open-science-introduction)

The research I conduct is recorded (and timestamped) on the OSF. For my studies, they are preregistered and where appropriate, the data and materials are shared openly.
