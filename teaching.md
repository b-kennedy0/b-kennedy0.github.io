<blockquote>"I’ve been taught by Brad since my first year in undergrad, and he has always without fail managed to teach and explain very thoroughly, clearly and patiently. He always has the time of the day for you whether that’s in class or after class. I truly do not think I would’ve got as good as a grade during my undergraduate years without Brads guidance, and that still holds true during postgrad."  </blockquote>

<div>Student End-of-Year Evaluation (2022)</div>
<blockquote>"Brad's sense of humour. The way he carries out his lectures, it makes you feel involved and excited to learn. When I came to uni I don't know what I expected, maybe a large lecture room with the lecturers being distant and not really stopping to check if everyone has understood everything and that we as students needed to keep up. Some of that is true, but at the same time Brad, for example, is really helpful and supportive. I feel excited for my lectures when I know Brad will be carrying them out."</blockquote>

<div>Student End-of-Year Evaluation (2022)</div>
<blockquote>"Brad was extremely positive and knowledgeable. It was an open and friendly environment, where we could all learn and share together. It was easy to express if we were unsure of anything and that are questions would be answered and our minds put at ease."</blockquote>

<div>Student Nomination for Teaching Award (2021)</div>
<blockquote>“Brad this year has been an amazing lecturer both in person and online. His style of teaching and personality has really helped my learning this year especially with the difficulty of people not participating in class as much as I would expect. Despite this difficulty, Brad keeps the seminar interesting, engaging and fun which has helped me remember 'golden nuggets' of information with ease that he provides in interesting ways. He lets his passion shine through so there is never a dull moment. I thoroughly enjoy every lecture.”</blockquote>

He is funny and friendly but also he is really good at explaining things and getting students involved in seminars. When I’ve emailed or asked questions I’ve gotten everything I needed to know from his responses. Before coming I liked psychology but now I love it more as his lectures have helped me realise how much I enjoy studying it. Overall made my first year enjoyable!"  </blockquote>
